# Project Topic

**Comparative Analysis of Turkey's Development Using Key Demographic Indicators**

In this project, we analyze Turkey's development status compared to more developed, less developed, and least developed countries. The comparison is conducted on a year-by-year basis, focusing on key demographic indicators such as mortality rates, birth rates, population trends, and other relevant factors.

# Data Set

We obtained the data set from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. You can access the relevant data set from the link below:

[United Nations Demographic Indicators Dataset](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicator%20(Standard)/EXCEL_FILES/1_General/WPP2024_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT.xlsx){.uri}

The original data set required a thorough cleaning process to ensure reliability and clarity for analysis.
