# Project Topic

**Comparative Analysis of Turkey's Development Using Key Demographic Indicators**

In this project, we analyze Turkey's development status compared to more developed, less developed, and least developed countries. The comparison is conducted on a year-by-year basis, focusing on key demographic indicators such as mortality rates, birth rates, population trends, and other relevant factors.

# Data Set

We obtained the data set from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. You can access the relevant data set from the link below:

The original data set required a thorough cleaning process to ensure reliability and clarity for analysis.

**Cleaning Process and Grouping**

1.  **Cleaning Process:**

    -   Missing or incomplete data entries were identified and addressed to maintain the dataset's integrity.

    -   Duplicates and irrelevant rows were removed.

    -   Relevant data for "Turkey," "More Developed," "Less Developed," and "Least Developed" groups were extracted for focused analysis.

2.  **Grouping Process:**\
    To simplify and enhance our analysis, the cleaned data set was divided into several key groups based on demographic parameters:

    -   **Change in Population**: Trends and shifts in population size over the years.

    -   **Child Demographics**: Birth rates and child-related population indicators.

    -   **Death Rate**: Annual death rates across groups.

    -   **Life Expectancy**: Average life expectancy trends over time.

    -   **Mortality**: Mortality rates segmented by different age groups and causes.

    -   **Population Dynamics**: Overall population trends and growth patterns.

    -   **Total Deaths**: Aggregate death counts across years.

    -   **Other Parameters**: Additional indicators relevant to the demographic and economic development of regions.
