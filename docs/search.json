The PPI is a critical index used to measure price changes at the consumer level and the overall inflation rate, providing insights into the general health of the economy. However, examining the PPI in isolation may fall short of capturing the multidimensional factors influencing it. Therefore, this project will comprehensively explore the relationship between the PPI and other key economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), exchange rates, energy price index, housing price index, import price index, interest rates, consumer confidence index, consumer expenditures, and credit card usage.\n\n\nData Set\nThe data utilized in the project consists of the following indices and indicators:\n‚Ä¢ Producer Price Index (PPI)\n‚Ä¢ Exchange Rates\n‚Ä¢ Energy Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Housing Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Import Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Interest Rates\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Confidence Index\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Credit Card Usage\nThe data for the analysis is sourced from reliable institutions such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUƒ∞K) and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB). The dataset is sufficiently large and up-to-date, enabling meaningful relationships to be established between economic indicators.\nThe primary objective of the project is to identify the factors affecting the PPI, reveal how these factors interact with the PPI, and provide a broader economic perspective based on the findings. Statistical and data analysis methods will be employed to examine the correlations, causality relationships, and temporal dynamics between the PPI and other indicators, shedding light on which indicators have more pronounced impacts on the PPI. This process will also help better understand critical dynamics unique to Turkey‚Äôs economic structure, such as the significant influence of exchange rates and energy prices on the PPI.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1-Producer Price Index vs Consumer Price Index\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been analyzed. While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, CPI reflects changes in the prices paid by consumers. The interaction between these indices is crucial for understanding price formation processes, as changes in production costs (PPI) can often translate into consumer prices (CPI). This analysis examines how changes in PPI affect CPI and evaluates the interaction between these two economic indicators. Using historical data and various statistical methods, the direction and magnitude of this relationship have been revealed.\nBased on this analysis we will choose PPI or CPI as our baseline to compare it‚Äôs effects on other economic indicators.\nFirst let‚Äôs look the table we will use for analysis.We used annual percentage changes of the variables as index values.\nFirst let‚Äôs look the table we will use for analysis.We used annual percentage changes of the variables as index values.\n\nhead(table_ppi_cpi,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   Tarih        PPI   CPI\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9  20.4 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6  19.7 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6  19.7 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1  19.5 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7  18.7 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0  15.7 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7  16.6 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4  15.0 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45  9.26\n10 2019-10-01  1.7   8.55\n\n\nWe will plot a line graph where we will show both index as a variable over time.This will help us to visualize their relation.\n\ngraph_line1 &lt;- ggplot(table_ppi_cpi, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PP Index(%)\" )) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = CPI, color = \"Cp Index(%)\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PP Index(%)\" = \"black\", \"Cp Index(%)\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI&CPI Graph\",\n       x = \"Tarih\",\n       y = \"Variable\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal()+theme_economist()\ngraph_line1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the graph above,it seems both indexes have a similar behaviour over time.By just looking at this graph,we may think there is a strong relation between them.They track each others movement on the graph.But just visuality may not be enough therefore we will do a correlation test.\n\ncor_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(table_ppi_cpi$PPI, table_ppi_cpi$CPI)\nprint(cor_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.7959363\n\ncortest_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor.test(table_ppi_cpi$PPI, table_ppi_cpi$CPI)\nprint(cortest_ppi_cpi$p.value)\n\n[1] 1.087791e-16\n\n\nThis correlation value supports visual data and says there is really strong relation between them.Also, p-value(1.087791e-16) is very low.Usually,results are considered significant if they are less than 0.5.In this case, the probability of the course of the situation arising by chance is extremely low.But what happens if there is some lag between interaction.Let‚Äôs do some lagged correlation tests.\n\ndata_ppi_cpi&lt;- table_ppi_cpi %&gt;%\n  mutate(PPI_lag1 = lag(PPI, 1),\n        PPI_lag2 = lag(PPI, 2),\n         PPI_lag3 = lag(PPI, 3),\n         PPI_lag4 = lag(PPI, 4),PPI_lag5 = lag(PPI, 5))\n\ncor_lag1_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag1, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag2_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag2, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag3_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag3, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag4_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag4, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(cor_lag1_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.8098936\n\nprint(cor_lag2_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.7947913\n\nprint(cor_lag3_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.7669985\n\nprint(cor_lag4_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.732202\n\n\nHighest correlation is 0.809 with a 1 unit time lag.More than 1 unit time lag,correlation values is decreasing and they are less than original correlation value.There is not an obvious increase on values with lag.But still it‚Äôs proves there is a strong relation between two index.But which index affects the other?Which index should we use as a independent variable to analyse other economic indicators‚Äôs behaviours?We should Grenger casuality test to decide.\n\ngrangertest(PPI ~ CPI, order = 2, data = table_ppi_cpi)\n\nGranger causality test\n\nModel 1: PPI ~ Lags(PPI, 1:2) + Lags(CPI, 1:2)\nModel 2: PPI ~ Lags(PPI, 1:2)\n  Res.Df Df      F Pr(&gt;F)\n1     64                 \n2     66 -2 2.3675 0.1019\n\ngrangertest(CPI ~ PPI, order = 2, data = table_ppi_cpi)\n\nGranger causality test\n\nModel 1: CPI ~ Lags(CPI, 1:2) + Lags(PPI, 1:2)\nModel 2: CPI ~ Lags(CPI, 1:2)\n  Res.Df Df      F    Pr(&gt;F)    \n1     64                        \n2     66 -2 11.208 6.712e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nFirst Granger test examines if CPI affects PPI values and it has a p-value as 0.1019 which is too high.That means CPI values does not have a effect on PPI values. On the other hand,second Granger test examinse if PPI affects CPI values and it has a p-value as 6.712e-05 which is very low.Generally p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically meaningful.Thus,we can say PPI values does affect CPI values. Finally we can say PPI can be independent variable for our further analysis.That‚Äôs why we choose PPI as our inflation rate. Before continue on further analysis we will do a regression analysis between PPI and CPI to better understanding of their relation.\n\nreg_model &lt;- lm(CPI ~ PPI, data = data_ppi_cpi)\nsummary(reg_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = CPI ~ PPI, data = data_ppi_cpi)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-19.811 -10.354  -6.141   5.421  32.803 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The positive sign indicates that an increase in PPI results in an increase in CPI.\nP-values (for coefficients):\nIntercept:p=8.8ùëí-0.6 PPI coefficient=p&lt;2ùëí-16\nSince the p-values for both coefficients are less than 0.05, they are statistically significant. This supports the conclusion that the independent variable (PPI) has a significant effect on the dependent variable (CPI).\nMultiple R-squared:0.6335 This value indicates that the model explains 63.35% of the total variation in the CPI variable. This suggests a strong relationship, although 36.65% of the variation remains unexplained. The model has reasonable explanatory power.\nF-Statistic:119.3, p&lt; 2.2ùëí- 16\nThis test evaluates the overall significance of the model. It shows that PPI is a significant variable for predicting CPI. The very small p-value (&lt; 0.05) confirms that the model as a whole is statistically significant.\nRegression equation:\nCPI = 13.99 + 0.49669.PPI\nAnd there is graph with regression line.\n\nreg_graph\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-Producer Price Index vs Credit Card Usage\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and credit card usage has been analyzed. PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, while credit card usage is an important indicator reflecting consumer spending habits and economic activity. The interaction between these two variables is critical for understanding the impact of economic fluctuations and price changes on consumer behavior. Using historical data, the study examines how changes in PPI affect credit card usage and evaluates the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.\nData we will use is again annual percentage changes for both variables and it accounts last 6 years since 2019.\nFirst let‚Äôs take a look our data frame!\n\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Barƒ±≈ü/Desktop/vfdbcbcv\")\nccu &lt;- read_excel(\"credit.xlsx\")\nppi &lt;- read_excel(\"ppi.xlsx\")\ntable_ppi_ccu &lt;- left_join(ppi,ccu, by =\"Tarih\")\ntable_ppi_ccu$Tarih &lt;- as.Date(paste0(\"01-\", table_ppi_ccu$Tarih), format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\nhead(table_ppi_ccu,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   Tarih        PPI  usage\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9   13.2 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6   13.5 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6   15.9 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1   10.1 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7   40.9 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0  -10.3 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7   13.2 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4   12.3 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45   6.35\n10 2019-10-01  1.7    8.52\n\n\nPPI=PRODUCER PRICE INDEX\nUSAGE=CREDƒ∞T CART USAGE AMOUNT\nWe will plot a line graph where we will show both index as a variable over time.This will help us to visualize their relation.\n\nggp2 &lt;- ggplot(table_ppi_ccu, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PP Index\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = usage, color = \"CC Usage\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PP Index\" = \"black\", \"CC Usage\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI&CCU Graph\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Variables(%)\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal()+theme_economist()\n\n\nggp2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a legitimate guess about their relation with this visualized data.But we need analytical results to interpret the results.Therefore, we will do a correlation test between them.\n\ncor_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(table_ppi_ccu$PPI, table_ppi_ccu$usage)\ncortest_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor.test(table_ppi_ccu$PPI, table_ppi_ccu$usage)\nprint(cor_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.60305\n\nprint(cortest_ppi_ccu$p.value)\n\n[1] 2.615285e-08\n\n\nCorrelation value for PPI and CCU is 0.603 which is pretty high.This means there is a relaively strong relation between them.Also p-value is less than 0.05 which means it is statistically meaningful.We also will do a correlation test with time lag to go deeper.\n\ndata_ppi_ccu &lt;- table_ppi_ccu %&gt;%\n  mutate(PPI_lag1 = lag(PPI, 1),\n         PPI_lag2 = lag(PPI, 2),\n         PPI_lag3 = lag(PPI, 3),\n         PPI_lag4=lag(PPI,4),\n         PPI_lag5=lag(PPI,5))\ncor_lag1_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag1, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag2_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag2, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag3_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag3, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag4_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag4, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag5_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag5, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(cor_lag1_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6165495\n\nprint(cor_lag2_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6422825\n\nprint(cor_lag3_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6536861\n\nprint(cor_lag4_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6713074\n\nprint(cor_lag5_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6726063\n\n\nAs the lag time increases, the correlation value increases. After the 4th and 5th delay, the rate of increase slows down.So we can say PPI values causes CCU Therefore, we can say that PPI has a delayed effect on credit card usage which is higher than correlation value without time lag.\n3-PRODUCER PRICE INDEX VS INTEREST RATE\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and interest rates has been analyzed. While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, interest rates are a critical macroeconomic indicator influencing economic growth, consumption, and investment decisions. The interaction between these two variables is significant for understanding inflation dynamics and supporting economic policy decisions. Using historical data, the study evaluates the impact of changes in PPI on interest rates and examines the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.First let‚Äôs take a look at our data table:\n\nhead(data_yusuf0,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   DATE         PPI    IR\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 20.4   30.5\n 2 2019-02-01 19.7   26.2\n 3 2019-03-01 19.7   22.8\n 4 2019-04-01 19.5   24.3\n 5 2019-05-01 18.7   27.8\n 6 2019-06-01 15.7   28.6\n 7 2019-07-01 16.6   26.9\n 8 2019-08-01 15.0   21.2\n 9 2019-09-01  9.26  18.2\n10 2019-10-01  8.55  17.2\n\n\nNow we will sketch a graph line for visualization purposes.\n\nggplot(data=data_yusuf, aes(x=DATE)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=PPI, color=\"PPI\"), size=1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=IR, color=\"Interest Rate (IR)\"), size=1, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  labs(title=\"PPI vs Interest Rate Over Time\", x=\"Date\", y=\"Values\", color=\"Legend\") +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_color_economist()\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we need analytical data we will implement a correlation test for this two economic indicators.\n\ncor_interest &lt;- cor(data_yusuf$PPI, data_yusuf$IR)\nprint(cor_interest)\n\n[1] 0.6384482\n\ncortest_interest &lt;- cor.test(data_yusuf$PPI, data_yusuf$IR)\nprint(cortest_interest$p.value)\n\n[1] 2.099621e-09\n\n\nCorrelation value is 0.638 which means these two indicators has a moderatly strong relation.Also p-value is less than 0.05 and this indicates this correlation value is significantly meaningfull.To conclude,we can say PPI and Interest Rate indicators can affects each other moderatly.\n4-PRODUCER PRICE INDEX VS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX\nThis study analyzes the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI). While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, the Consumer Confidence Index reflects the sentiment and expectations of consumers regarding the economy. Understanding the interaction between these two indicators is crucial for assessing the impact of price changes on consumer perceptions and behavior. Using historical data, the study examines how changes in PPI influence consumer confidence and evaluates the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.\nFirst let‚Äôs take a look at our data frame:\n\nhead(data_yusuf1,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   DATE         PPI   CCI\n   &lt;date&gt;

    "text": "R‚ÄôHAPSODY: A Data Analysis Project\nExploring Economic Dynamics Through PPI\nThe R‚ÄôHAPSODY project embarks on a journey to decode one of the Turkish economy‚Äôs pivotal macroeconomic indicators: the Producer Price Index (PPI). Serving as a benchmark for tracking inflation and price shifts in consumer goods, PPI is essential for understanding economic health. However, to gain a more holistic view of economic trends, our project extends its focus to explore how PPI interacts with a range of influential variables.\nData and Sources\nWe have incorporated multiple economic indicators into our analysis, including:\n\nProducer Price Index (PPI)\nExchange Rates\nEnergy Prices\nHousing Prices\nImport Prices\nInterest Rates\nConsumer Confidence\nConsumer Price Index(CPI)\nCredit Card Usage(CCU)\n\nThe dataset, collected from a very trusted source such as the the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB), provides a robust foundation for discovering meaningful patterns and relationships.\nWhy This Data?\nThe Turkish economy is characterized by its complexity, where factors like volatile exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices play outsized roles. By combining PPI with these auxiliary indicators, our project aims to offer fresh perspectives on the intricate web of economic interactions, enhancing our understanding of what drives inflation and consumer behavior in Turkey.\nProject Objectives\n\nUnderstanding Influences: To identify which factors significantly impact PPI.\nMapping Relationships: To examine the interplay between PPI and other economic variables.\nDeriving Insights: To provide a data-backed interpretation of Turkey‚Äôs macroeconomic structure, highlighting critical influences like exchange rates and energy prices.\n\nKey Milestones Achieved\n\nCleaned and integrated diverse datasets to establish a comprehensive analytical framework.\nConducted statistical evaluations to reveal correlations and causal links.\nHighlighted the unique dynamics shaping Turkey‚Äôs inflationary trends, such as the strong ties between PPI and energy price shifts.\n\n\n\nWhich Index Should We Choose as Our Baseline?\nWhen deciding on a baseline index for our analysis, we initially considered both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). Both indices are critical tools for measuring inflation, but they offer different perspectives on economic dynamics. While CPI focuses on the changes in prices faced by consumers, PPI measures the changes in prices at the production stage, capturing the cost dynamics experienced by producers.\nTo make an informed decision, we conducted a comparative analysis of CPI and PPI as part of the initial phase of our project. This analysis aimed to determine which index would provide deeper insights into the relationships we intended to explore.\nWhy Did We Choose PPI Over CPI?\nOur analysis revealed several key factors that guided our choice:\n\nCloser Link to Input Costs: PPI reflects the prices of goods at earlier stages of production, making it more sensitive to fluctuations in raw material costs, energy prices, and other input factors. This characteristic allows PPI to provide more direct insights into the production side of the economy.\nPredictive Power for Inflation Trends: PPI often serves as a leading indicator for CPI, as changes in producer prices can eventually influence consumer prices. By focusing on PPI, we can capture upstream economic dynamics that may precede broader inflationary trends.\nData Alignment with Objectives: The scope of our project emphasizes the relationships between economic indicators such as energy prices, import prices, and exchange rates‚Äîfactors that strongly impact PPI. This alignment made PPI a more suitable choice for our baseline.\n\nKey Findings from Statistical Tests\nTo reinforce our decision, we conducted correlation, Granger causality, and regression tests:\n\nCorrelation Analysis: We found a strong positive correlation of 0.80 between PPI and CPI, indicating a significant relationship between the two indices.\nGranger Causality Test: The results showed that PPI has a causal influence on CPI, meaning changes in producer prices tend to precede changes in consumer prices.\nRegression Analysis: Regression results further supported that PPI significantly impacts CPI, underlining its predictive power for consumer-level price changes.\n\nThrough this robust comparative and statistical analysis, we determined that PPI offers a more comprehensive foundation for understanding the economic dynamics central to our project. While CPI remains a valuable measure of inflation, PPI‚Äôs closer ties to production-level costs, predictive capabilities, and causal influence on CPI made it the ideal choice for our baseline index.\nThis decision ensures that our analysis is aligned with the project‚Äôs goals and enhances our ability to uncover meaningful relationships in Turkey‚Äôs economic structure.\nHOW DID WE IMPORT OUR DATA?\nWe collect our data from database of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB).\nhttps://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/\nWe selected the data from last 6 years,starting from 2019.We choose last 6 years and not more than that because we didn‚Äôt want to our data frames be so large and cause long process times.Also we didn‚Äôt want to choose less than 6 year because we want to be sure we have enough data to make our analysis meaningful.\nAs you can understand from above our data frames has a date column.For example:\n\nhead(ppi,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 2\n   Tarih     PPI\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 01-2019 32.9 \n 2 02-2019 29.6 \n 3 03-2019 29.6 \n 4 04-2019 30.1 \n 5 05-2019 28.7 \n 6 06-2019 25.0 \n 7 07-2019 21.7 \n 8 08-2019 13.4 \n 9 09-2019  2.45\n10 10-2019  1.7 \n\n\nBut,this format for date is not recognizable for R,therefore we had to transform it to suitable format with this code:\n\nppi$Tarih &lt;- as.Date(paste0(\"01-\", ppi$Tarih), format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\nhead(ppi,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 2\n   Tarih        PPI\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45\n10 2019-10-01  1.7 \n\n\nWe did this for all data frames to visualize them.This is the only preprocessing we conducted for our data.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThis study explores the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and other key economic indicators in Turkey.\nThe data was sourced from TCMB, covering variables like exchange rates, energy prices, and consumer expenditures.\nPPI was selected as the baseline index due to its predictive power and causal relationship with CPI.We treat PPI as inflation rate.\nWe aimed to understand which indicators has a strong relation with inflation rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
