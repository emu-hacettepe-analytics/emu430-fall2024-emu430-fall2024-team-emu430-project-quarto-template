The PPI is a critical index used to measure price changes at the consumer level and the overall inflation rate, providing insights into the general health of the economy. However, examining the PPI in isolation may fall short of capturing the multidimensional factors influencing it. Therefore, this project will comprehensively explore the relationship between the PPI and other key economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), exchange rates, energy price index, housing price index, import price index, interest rates, consumer confidence index, consumer expenditures, and credit card usage.\n\n\nData Set\nThe data utilized in the project consists of the following indices and indicators:\n‚Ä¢ Producer Price Index (PPI)\n‚Ä¢ Exchange Rates\n‚Ä¢ Energy Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Housing Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Import Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Interest Rates\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Confidence Index\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Credit Card Usage\nThe data for the analysis is sourced from reliable institutions such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUƒ∞K) and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB). The dataset is sufficiently large and up-to-date, enabling meaningful relationships to be established between economic indicators.\nThe primary objective of the project is to identify the factors affecting the PPI, reveal how these factors interact with the PPI, and provide a broader economic perspective based on the findings. Statistical and data analysis methods will be employed to examine the correlations, causality relationships, and temporal dynamics between the PPI and other indicators, shedding light on which indicators have more pronounced impacts on the PPI. This process will also help better understand critical dynamics unique to Turkey‚Äôs economic structure, such as the significant influence of exchange rates and energy prices on the PPI.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1-Producer Price Index vs Consumer Price Index\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been analyzed. While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, CPI reflects changes in the prices paid by consumers. The interaction between these indices is crucial for understanding price formation processes, as changes in production costs (PPI) can often translate into consumer prices (CPI). This analysis examines how changes in PPI affect CPI and evaluates the interaction between these two economic indicators. Using historical data and various statistical methods, the direction and magnitude of this relationship have been revealed.\nBased on this analysis we will choose PPI or CPI as our baseline to compare it‚Äôs effects on other economic indicators.\nFirst let‚Äôs look the table we will use for analysis.We used annual percentage changes of the variables as index values.\nFirst let‚Äôs look the table we will use for analysis.We used annual percentage changes of the variables as index values.\n\nhead(table2,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   Tarih        PPI   CPI\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9  20.4 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6  19.7 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6  19.7 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1  19.5 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7  18.7 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0  15.7 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7  16.6 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4  15.0 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45  9.26\n10 2019-10-01  1.7   8.55\n\n\nWe will plot a line graph where we will show both index as a variable over time.This will help us to visualize their relation.\n\ngraph_line1 &lt;- ggplot(table2, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PP Index(%)\" )) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = CPI, color = \"Cp Index(%)\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PP Index(%)\" = \"black\", \"Cp Index(%)\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI&CPI Graph\",\n       x = \"Tarih\",\n       y = \"Variable\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal()+theme_economist()\ngraph_line1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the graph above,it seems both indexes have a similar behaviour over time.By just looking at this graph,we may think there is a strong relation between them.They track each others movement on the graph.But just visuality may not be enough therefore we will do a correlation test.\n\ncorrelation1 &lt;- cor(table2$PPI, table2$CPI)\nprint(correlation1)\n\n[1] 0.7959363\n\ncor_test &lt;- cor.test(table2$PPI, table2$CPI)\nprint(cor_test$p.value)\n\n[1] 1.087791e-16\n\n\nThis correlation value supports visual data and says there is really strong relation between them.Also, p-value(1.087791e-16) is very low.Usually,results are considered significant if they are less than 0.5.In this case, the probability of the course of the situation arising by chance is extremely low.But what happens if there is some lag between interaction.Let‚Äôs do some lagged correlation tests.\n\ndata1 &lt;- table2 %&gt;%\n  mutate(PPI_lag1 = lag(PPI, 1),\n        PPI_lag2 = lag(PPI, 2),\n         PPI_lag3 = lag(PPI, 3),\n         PPI_lag4 = lag(PPI, 4),PPI_lag5 = lag(PPI, 5))\n\ncor_lag1 &lt;- cor(data1$PPI_lag1, data1$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag2 &lt;- cor(data1$PPI_lag2, data1$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag3 &lt;- cor(data1$PPI_lag3, data1$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag4 &lt;- cor(data1$PPI_lag4, data1$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(cor_lag1)\n\n[1] 0.8098936\n\nprint(cor_lag2)\n\n[1] 0.7947913\n\nprint(cor_lag3)\n\n[1] 0.7669985\n\nprint(cor_lag4)\n\n[1] 0.732202\n\n\nHighest correlation is 0.809 with a 1 unit time lag.More than 1 unit time lag,correlation values is decreasing and they are less than original correlation value.There is not an obvious increase on values with lag.But still it‚Äôs proves there is a strong relation between two index.But which index affects the other?Which index should we use as a independent variable to analyse other economic indicators‚Äôs behaviours?We should Grenger casuality test to decide.\n\ngrangertest(PPI ~ CPI, order = 2, data = table2)\n\nGranger causality test\n\nModel 1: PPI ~ Lags(PPI, 1:2) + Lags(CPI, 1:2)\nModel 2: PPI ~ Lags(PPI, 1:2)\n  Res.Df Df      F Pr(&gt;F)\n1     64                 \n2     66 -2 2.3675 0.1019\n\ngrangertest(CPI ~ PPI, order = 2, data = table2)\n\nGranger causality test\n\nModel 1: CPI ~ Lags(CPI, 1:2) + Lags(PPI, 1:2)\nModel 2: CPI ~ Lags(CPI, 1:2)\n  Res.Df Df      F    Pr(&gt;F)    \n1     64                        \n2     66 -2 11.208 6.712e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nFirst Granger test examines if CPI affects PPI values and it has a p-value as 0.1019 which is too high.That means CPI values does not have a effect on PPI values. On the other hand,second Granger test examinse if PPI affects CPI values and it has a p-value as 6.712e-05 which is very low.Generally p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically meaningful.Thus,we can say PPI values does affect CPI values. Finally we can say PPI can be independent variable for our further analysis.That‚Äôs why we choose PPI as our inflation rate. Before continue on further analysis we will do a regression analysis between PPI and CPI to better understanding of their relation.\n\nreg_model &lt;- lm(CPI ~ PPI, data = data1)\nsummary(reg_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = CPI ~ PPI, data = data1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-19.811 -10.354  -6.141   5.421  32.803 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The positive sign indicates that an increase in PPI results in an increase in CPI.\nP-values (for coefficients):\nIntercept:p=8.8ùëí-0.6 PPI coefficient=p&lt;2ùëí-16\nSince the p-values for both coefficients are less than 0.05, they are statistically significant. This supports the conclusion that the independent variable (PPI) has a significant effect on the dependent variable (CPI).\nMultiple R-squared:0.6335 This value indicates that the model explains 63.35% of the total variation in the CPI variable. This suggests a strong relationship, although 36.65% of the variation remains unexplained. The model has reasonable explanatory power.\nF-Statistic:119.3, p&lt; 2.2ùëí- 16\nThis test evaluates the overall significance of the model. It shows that PPI is a significant variable for predicting CPI. The very small p-value (&lt; 0.05) confirms that the model as a whole is statistically significant.\nRegression equation:\nCPI = 13.99 + 0.49669.PPI\nAnd there is graph with regression line.\n\nreg_graph\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
