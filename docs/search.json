    "text": "Once upon a time a group of wise men said ‚ÄúIs this the real life?Is this just a fantasy?‚Äù Well,we say our work can show which is it!\nPlease stay tuned to follow our project activities.\n\nTeam Members\n\nYusuf Karakulle\nEfe Kayra Torun\nBarƒ±≈ü Aksu\nFirdevs Elif Batur\nRamazan Ortas√∂z\n\n\n\nProject Topic\nThis project aims to deeply analyze one of the most significant macroeconomic indicators of the Turkish economy, the Producer Price Index (PPI), to better understand economic dynamics. The PPI is a critical index used to measure price changes at the consumer level and the overall inflation rate, providing insights into the general health of the economy. However, examining the PPI in isolation may fall short of capturing the multidimensional factors influencing it. Therefore, this project will comprehensively explore the relationship between the PPI and other key economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), exchange rates, energy price index, housing price index, import price index, interest rates, consumer confidence index, consumer expenditures, and credit card usage.\n\n\nData Set\nThe data utilized in the project consists of the following indices and indicators:\n‚Ä¢ Producer Price Index (PPI)\n‚Ä¢ Exchange Rates\n‚Ä¢ Energy Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Housing Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Import Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Interest Rates\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Confidence Index\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Price Index\n‚Ä¢ Credit Card Usage\nThe data for the analysis is sourced from reliable institutions such as the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUƒ∞K) and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB). The dataset is sufficiently large and up-to-date, enabling meaningful relationships to be established between economic indicators.\nThe primary objective of the project is to identify the factors affecting the PPI, reveal how these factors interact with the PPI, and provide a broader economic perspective based on the findings. Statistical and data analysis methods will be employed to examine the correlations, causality relationships, and temporal dynamics between the PPI and other indicators, shedding light on which indicators have more pronounced impacts on the PPI. This process will also help better understand critical dynamics unique to Turkey‚Äôs economic structure, such as the significant influence of exchange rates and energy prices on the PPI.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nWe calculated for correlation coefficients for all indicators and highest correlation coefficient is 0.88 between PPI and Housing Price Index.\nWe make a polynomial regression analysis for PPI and Credit Card Usage by taking a furter step analysis and it was a perfect fit for these two indicator.\nWe made a multiple regression analysis as our dependent variable PPI and our independent variables as Credit Card Usage,Housing Price Index and Consumer Confidence Index.And this model explains about 80.12% of the variability in PPI, which is strong.\n\n1-Producer Price Index vs Consumer Price Index\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been analyzed. While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, CPI reflects changes in the prices paid by consumers. The interaction between these indices is crucial for understanding price formation processes, as changes in production costs (PPI) can often translate into consumer prices (CPI). This analysis examines how changes in PPI affect CPI and evaluates the interaction between these two economic indicators. Using historical data and various statistical methods, the direction and magnitude of this relationship have been revealed.\nBased on this analysis we will choose PPI or CPI as our baseline to compare it‚Äôs effects on other economic indicators.\nFirst let‚Äôs look the table we will use for analysis.We used annual percentage changes of the variables as index values.\nFirst let‚Äôs look the table we will use for analysis.We used annual percentage changes of the variables as index values.\n\nhead(table_ppi_cpi,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   Tarih        PPI   CPI\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9  20.4 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6  19.7 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6  19.7 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1  19.5 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7  18.7 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0  15.7 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7  16.6 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4  15.0 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45  9.26\n10 2019-10-01  1.7   8.55\n\n\nWe will plot a line graph where we will show both index as a variable over time.This will help us to visualize their relation.\n\ngraph_line1 &lt;- ggplot(table_ppi_cpi, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PP Index(%)\" )) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = CPI, color = \"Cp Index(%)\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PP Index(%)\" = \"black\", \"Cp Index(%)\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI&CPI Graph\",\n       x = \"Tarih\",\n       y = \"Variable\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal()+theme_economist()\ngraph_line1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the graph above,it seems both indexes have a similar behaviour over time.By just looking at this graph,we may think there is a strong relation between them.They track each others movement on the graph.But just visuality may not be enough therefore we will do a correlation test.\n\ncor_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(table_ppi_cpi$PPI, table_ppi_cpi$CPI)\nprint(cor_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.7959363\n\ncortest_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor.test(table_ppi_cpi$PPI, table_ppi_cpi$CPI)\nprint(cortest_ppi_cpi$p.value)\n\n[1] 1.087791e-16\n\n\nThis correlation value supports visual data and says there is really strong relation between them.Also, p-value(1.087791e-16) is very low.Usually,results are considered significant if they are less than 0.5.In this case, the probability of the course of the situation arising by chance is extremely low.But what happens if there is some lag between interaction.Let‚Äôs do some lagged correlation tests.\n\ndata_ppi_cpi&lt;- table_ppi_cpi %&gt;%\n  mutate(PPI_lag1 = lag(PPI, 1),\n        PPI_lag2 = lag(PPI, 2),\n         PPI_lag3 = lag(PPI, 3),\n         PPI_lag4 = lag(PPI, 4),PPI_lag5 = lag(PPI, 5))\n\ncor_lag1_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag1, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag2_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag2, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag3_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag3, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag4_ppi_cpi &lt;- cor(data_ppi_cpi$PPI_lag4, data_ppi_cpi$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(cor_lag1_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.8098936\n\nprint(cor_lag2_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.7947913\n\nprint(cor_lag3_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.7669985\n\nprint(cor_lag4_ppi_cpi)\n\n[1] 0.732202\n\n\nHighest correlation is 0.809 with a 1 unit time lag.More than 1 unit time lag,correlation values is decreasing and they are less than original correlation value.There is not an obvious increase on values with lag.But still it‚Äôs proves there is a strong relation between two index.But which index affects the other?Which index should we use as a independent variable to analyse other economic indicators‚Äôs behaviours?We should Grenger casuality test to decide.\n\ngrangertest(PPI ~ CPI, order = 2, data = table_ppi_cpi)\n\nGranger causality test\n\nModel 1: PPI ~ Lags(PPI, 1:2) + Lags(CPI, 1:2)\nModel 2: PPI ~ Lags(PPI, 1:2)\n  Res.Df Df      F Pr(&gt;F)\n1     64                 \n2     66 -2 2.3675 0.1019\n\ngrangertest(CPI ~ PPI, order = 2, data = table_ppi_cpi)\n\nGranger causality test\n\nModel 1: CPI ~ Lags(CPI, 1:2) + Lags(PPI, 1:2)\nModel 2: CPI ~ Lags(CPI, 1:2)\n  Res.Df Df      F    Pr(&gt;F)    \n1     64                        \n2     66 -2 11.208 6.712e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nFirst Granger test examines if CPI affects PPI values and it has a p-value as 0.1019 which is too high.That means CPI values does not have a effect on PPI values. On the other hand,second Granger test examinse if PPI affects CPI values and it has a p-value as 6.712e-05 which is very low.Generally p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically meaningful.Thus,we can say PPI values does affect CPI values. Finally we can say PPI can be independent variable for our further analysis.That‚Äôs why we choose PPI as our inflation rate.

The positive sign indicates that an increase in PPI results in an increase in CPI.\nP-values (for coefficients):\nIntercept:p=8.8ùëí-0.6 PPI coefficient=p&lt;2ùëí-16\nSince the p-values for both coefficients are less than 0.05, they are statistically significant. This supports the conclusion that the independent variable (PPI) has a significant effect on the dependent variable (CPI).\nMultiple R-squared:0.6335\nThis value indicates that the model explains 63.35% of the total variation in the CPI variable. This suggests a strong relationship, although 36.65% of the variation remains unexplained. The model has reasonable explanatory power.\nF-Statistic:119.3, p&lt; 2.2ùëí- 16\nThis test evaluates the overall significance of the model. It shows that PPI is a significant variable for predicting CPI. The very small p-value (&lt; 0.05) confirms that the model as a whole is statistically significant.\nRegression equation:\nCPI = 13.99 + 0.49669.PPI\nAnd there is graph with regression line.\n\ndata_ppi_cpi$Tarih &lt;- as.Date(paste0(\"01-\", data_ppi_cpi$Tarih), format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\nreg_graph&lt;-ggplot(data_ppi_cpi, aes(x = PPI, y = CPI)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = TRUE) \n  labs(title = \"Regression Analysis: PPI vs CPI\",\n       x = \"Producer Price Index (PPI)\",\n       y = \"Consumer Price Index (CPI)\")\n\n$x\n[1] \"Producer Price Index (PPI)\"\n\n$y\n[1] \"Consumer Price Index (CPI)\"\n\n$title\n[1] \"Regression Analysis: PPI vs CPI\"\n\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"labels\"\n\n\n\nreg_graph\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-Producer Price Index vs Credit Card Usage\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and credit card usage has been analyzed. PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, while credit card usage is an important indicator reflecting consumer spending habits and economic activity. The interaction between these two variables is critical for understanding the impact of economic fluctuations and price changes on consumer behavior. Using historical data, the study examines how changes in PPI affect credit card usage and evaluates the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.\nData we will use is again annual percentage changes for both variables and it accounts last 6 years since 2019.\nFirst let‚Äôs take a look our data frame!\n\nhead(table_ppi_ccu,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   Tarih        PPI  usage\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9   13.2 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6   13.5 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6   15.9 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1   10.1 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7   40.9 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0  -10.3 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7   13.2 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4   12.3 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45   6.35\n10 2019-10-01  1.7    8.52\n\n\nPPI=PRODUCER PRICE INDEX\nUSAGE=CREDƒ∞T CART USAGE AMOUNT\nWe will plot a line graph where we will show both index as a variable over time.This will help us to visualize their relation.\n\nggp2 &lt;- ggplot(table_ppi_ccu, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PP Index\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = usage, color = \"CC Usage\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PP Index\" = \"black\", \"CC Usage\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI&CCU Graph\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Variables(%)\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal()+theme_economist()\n\n\nggp2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can make a legitimate guess about their relation with this visualized data.But we need analytical results to interpret the results.Therefore, we will do a correlation test between them.\n\ncor_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(table_ppi_ccu$PPI, table_ppi_ccu$usage)\ncortest_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor.test(table_ppi_ccu$PPI, table_ppi_ccu$usage)\nprint(cor_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.60305\n\nprint(cortest_ppi_ccu$p.value)\n\n[1] 2.615285e-08\n\n\nCorrelation value for PPI and CCU is 0.603 which is pretty high.This means there is a relaively strong relation between them.Also p-value is less than 0.05 which means it is statistically meaningful.We also will do a correlation test with time lag to go deeper.\n\ndata_ppi_ccu &lt;- table_ppi_ccu %&gt;%\n  mutate(PPI_lag1 = lag(PPI, 1),\n         PPI_lag2 = lag(PPI, 2),\n         PPI_lag3 = lag(PPI, 3),\n         PPI_lag4=lag(PPI,4),\n         PPI_lag5=lag(PPI,5))\ncor_lag1_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag1, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag2_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag2, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag3_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag3, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag4_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag4, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\ncor_lag5_ppi_ccu &lt;- cor(data_ppi_ccu$PPI_lag5, data_ppi_ccu$usage, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(cor_lag1_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6165495\n\nprint(cor_lag2_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6422825\n\nprint(cor_lag3_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6536861\n\nprint(cor_lag4_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6713074\n\nprint(cor_lag5_ppi_ccu)\n\n[1] 0.6726063\n\n\nAs the lag time increases, the correlation value increases. After the 4th and 5th delay, the rate of increase slows down.So we can say PPI values causes CCU Therefore, we can say that PPI has a delayed effect on credit card usage which is higher than correlation value without time lag.\n3-PRODUCER PRICE INDEX VS INTEREST RATE\nIn this study, the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and interest rates has been analyzed. While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, interest rates are a critical macroeconomic indicator influencing economic growth, consumption, and investment decisions. The interaction between these two variables is significant for understanding inflation dynamics and supporting economic policy decisions. Using historical data, the study evaluates the impact of changes in PPI on interest rates and examines the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.First let‚Äôs take a look at our data table:\n\nhead(data_yusuf0,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   DATE         PPI    IR\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9   30.5\n 2 2019-02-01 29.6   26.2\n 3 2019-03-01 29.6   22.8\n 4 2019-04-01 30.1   24.3\n 5 2019-05-01 28.7   27.8\n 6 2019-06-01 25.0   28.6\n 7 2019-07-01 21.7   26.9\n 8 2019-08-01 13.4   21.2\n 9 2019-09-01  2.45  18.2\n10 2019-10-01  1.7   17.2\n\n\nNow we will sketch a graph line for visualization purposes.\n\nggplot(data=data_yusuf, aes(x=DATE)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=PPI, color=\"PPI\"), size=1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=IR, color=\"Interest Rate (IR)\"), size=1, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  labs(title=\"PPI vs Interest Rate Over Time\", x=\"Date\", y=\"Values\", color=\"Legend\") +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_color_economist()\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\n‚Ñπ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we need analytical data we will implement a correlation test for this two economic indicators.\n\ncor_interest &lt;- cor(data_yusuf$PPI, data_yusuf$IR)\nprint(cor_interest)\n\n[1] 0.1198634\n\ncortest_interest &lt;- cor.test(data_yusuf$PPI, data_yusuf$IR)\nprint(cortest_interest$p.value)\n\n[1] 0.3194176\n\n\nCorrelation value is 0.119 which means these two indicators does not have a strong relation.Also p-value is more than 0.05 and this indicates this correlation value is NOT significantly meaningfull.To conclude,we can say we did not find a clue about relation between PPI and Interest Rate indicators.\n4-PRODUCER PRICE INDEX VS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX\nThis study analyzes the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI). While PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, the Consumer Confidence Index reflects the sentiment and expectations of consumers regarding the economy. Understanding the interaction between these two indicators is crucial for assessing the impact of price changes on consumer perceptions and behavior. Using historical data, the study examines how changes in PPI influence consumer confidence and evaluates the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.\nFirst let‚Äôs take a look at our data frame:\n\nhead(data_yusuf1,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 3\n   DATE         PPI   CCI\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9   127.\n 2 2019-02-01 29.6   131.\n 3 2019-03-01 29.6   140.\n 4 2019-04-01 30.1   139.\n 5 2019-05-01 28.7   143.\n 6 2019-06-01 25.0   153.\n 7 2019-07-01 21.7   148.\n 8 2019-08-01 13.4   130.\n 9 2019-09-01  2.45  139.\n10 2019-10-01  1.7   142.\n\n\nAnd again as we have done all above we will sketch a line graph:\n\ngraph_yusuf1&lt;-ggplot(data=data_yusuf, aes(x=DATE)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=PPI, color=\"PPI\"), size=1) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=CCI, color=\"Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)\"), size=1, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  labs(title=\"PPI vs Consumer Confidence Index Over Time\", x=\"Date\", y=\"Values\", color=\"Legend\") +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_color_economist()\ngraph_yusuf1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can not clearly see their relation by just looking at it therefore we will conduct a correlation test again.\n\ncor_confidence &lt;- cor(data_yusuf$PPI, data_yusuf$CCI)\nprint(cor_confidence)\n\n[1] 0.4221268\n\ncortest_confidence &lt;- cor.test(data_yusuf$PPI, data_yusuf$CCI)\nprint(cortest_confidence$p.value)\n\n[1] 0.0002456725\n\n\n0.422 is relatively low to say these indicators has a notable relation but p-value is low enough to be statisticaly meaningful.So we can easily say we can confirm that there is a relation bewteen PPI and CCI and this relation is not strong.\n5-PRODUCER PRICE INDEX VS HOUSUNG PRICE INDEX\nThis study examines the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Housing Price Index (HPI). While PPI tracks changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, HPI reflects fluctuations in residential property prices. Understanding the interaction between these two indices is essential for analyzing how changes in production costs influence the housing market. Using historical data, the study investigates the impact of PPI on housing prices and evaluates the direction and strength of this relationship through various statistical methods.\nLet‚Äôs take a look at our table!\n\nhead(ppi_housing,10)\n\n        Tarih   PPI Housing_Percentage_Change\n1  2019-01-01 32.93                  3.362152\n2  2019-02-01 29.59                  3.625954\n3  2019-03-01 29.64                  3.122044\n4  2019-04-01 30.12                  2.054155\n5  2019-05-01 28.71                  1.473297\n6  2019-06-01 25.04                  1.741522\n7  2019-07-01 21.66                  2.836231\n8  2019-08-01 13.45                  5.243790\n9  2019-09-01  2.45                  6.864564\n10 2019-10-01  1.70                  6.912442\n\n\nNow we will plot a graph line:\n\nppi_housing_graph &lt;- ggplot(ppi_housing, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PPI\")) +  \n  geom_line(aes(y = Housing_Percentage_Change, color = \"Housing Change\")) +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PPI\" = \"red\", \"Housing Change\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI & Housing Change Graph\",\n       x = \"Tarih\",\n       y = \"Variable\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme_economist()\nprint(ppi_housing_graph)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see in the graph that this tho index values are almost stick to each other.Now let‚Äôs do a correlation test and see if we can verify that.\n\ncorrelation_house &lt;- cor(ppi_housing$PPI, ppi_housing$Housing_Percentage_Change, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(paste(\"Korelasyon Katsayƒ±sƒ±: \", correlation_house))\n\n[1] \"Korelasyon Katsayƒ±sƒ±:  0.888596687452896\"\n\n\nAccording to this correlation value,these two indicators has a ver powerful relation which verify our visual observatoin.And p-value is too low which means this relation is statistically meaningful.\n6-PRODUCER PRICE INDEX and ENERGY PRICE INDEX\nThis study explores the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Brent Oil prices. PPI measures changes in the prices of goods and services at the producer level, while Brent Crude Oil serves as a benchmark for global oil prices, influencing production costs across various industries. The interaction between these two indicators is critical for understanding the impact of energy price fluctuations on broader economic price dynamics. Using historical data, the study investigates how changes in Brent Crude Oil prices affect PPI and evaluates the direction and magnitude of this relationship through various statistical methods.\nLet‚Äôs take a look our data frame!\n\nhead(ppi_petrol,10)\n\n        Tarih   PPI TP_BrentPetrol\n1  2019-01-01 32.93      -7.848923\n2  2019-02-01 29.59      -1.588983\n3  2019-03-01 29.64      -1.579252\n4  2019-04-01 30.12      -4.913066\n5  2019-05-01 28.71     -12.648790\n6  2019-06-01 25.04     -12.809917\n7  2019-07-01 21.66     -13.605717\n8  2019-08-01 13.45     -20.665454\n9  2019-09-01  2.45     -26.269342\n10 2019-10-01  1.70     -20.764297\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs sketch a graph line and then calculate correlation value to see these two indicator‚Äôs relation.\n\nppi_petrol_graph &lt;- ggplot(ppi_petrol, aes(x = Tarih)) +      \n  geom_line(aes(y = PPI, color = \"PPI\")) +  \n  geom_line(aes(y = TP_BrentPetrol, color = \"Petrol Change\")) +  \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PPI\" = \"red\", \"Petrol Change\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI & Petrol Change Graph\",\n       x = \"Tarih\",\n       y = \"Variable\",\n       color = \"Variables\") + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme_economist()\nprint(ppi_petrol_graph)\n\nWarning: Removed 7 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_line()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation for PPI and Brent Oil prices:\n\ncorrelation_petrol &lt;- cor(ppi_petrol$PPI, ppi_petrol$TP_BrentPetrol, use = \"complete.obs\")\nprint(paste(\"Korelasyon Katsayƒ±sƒ±: \", correlation_petrol))\n\n[1] \"Korelasyon Katsayƒ±sƒ±:  0.247511777625547\"\n\ncortest_petrol&lt;-cor.test(ppi_petrol$PPI, ppi_petrol$TP_BrentPetrol)\nprint(paste(\"P-Value: \",cortest_petrol$p.value))\n\n[1] \"P-Value:  0.0468302492457841\"\n\n\nCorrelation valu for PPI and Brent Oil prices is 0.603 which is moderatly high.P-value is 0.03 means this correlation test is statistically meaningful.We can say that there is a relation between these two economic indicators.\n7-PRODEUCER PRICE INDEX and EXCHANGE RATE(USD)\nIn this study, we will compare PPI with 2 of our economic metrics and examine the relationship between them both visually with line charts and with our correlation calculations. We collected our data from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey‚Äôs website for 4 years with monthly periods and combined them in a file. Our data consists of 4 columns in an Excel file. The first row contains the date, the second column PPI, the third column USD and the fourth column Import Price Index. Let‚Äôs start our study by examining the first 10 rows¬†of¬†our¬†data.\n\nhead(dataefe, n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 4\n   Date       `PPI (%)`   USD `Import Unit Value Index (TL)`\n   &lt;date&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;                          &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01    0.329   5.37                           207.\n 2 2019-02-01    0.296   5.26                           201.\n 3 2019-03-01    0.296   5.44                           210.\n 4 2019-04-01    0.301   5.74                           220.\n 5 2019-05-01    0.287   6.05                           228.\n 6 2019-06-01    0.250   5.81                           219.\n 7 2019-07-01    0.217   5.67                           213.\n 8 2019-08-01    0.134   5.62                           207.\n 9 2019-09-01    0.0245  5.71                           209.\n10 2019-10-01    0.017   5.78                           212.\n\n\nChart shows how the PPI (blue) and the exchange rate (USD, red) change over time. In mid-2021, the PPI rises sharply, while the USD exchange rate increases more gradually. Entering 2022, the PPI rises rapidly, but the exchange rate does not quite keep pace over the same period. After 2023, the exchange rate continues to rise, but the PPI starts to fall. This suggests that PPI can be driven by factors other than the exchange rate.\n\ngraph_usd &lt;- dataefe |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = `PPI (%)`, color = \"PPI (%)\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = USD * scale_usd, color = \"Exchange Rate (USD)\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"PPI (%)\",\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scale_usd, name = \"Exchange Rate (USD)\")\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PPI (%)\" = \"blue\", \"Exchange Rate (USD)\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI (%) vs Exchange Rate (USD) Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"PPI (%)\",\n       color = \"Variables\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme_economist()\ngraph_usd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between the PPI (blue) and the Import Price Index (orange) is clearer and more harmonized. Both indicators follow a similar pattern, moving almost together between 2021 and 2022. Towards the end of 2021 they both peak, but the PPI then falls sharply, while the Import Price Index continues to rise at a more steady pace. This could mean that rising import prices are affecting the PPI, but it may take some time for the effect to be seen.\n\ngraph_import &lt;- dataefe |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Date)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = `PPI (%)`, color = \"PPI (%)\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = `Import Unit Value Index (TL)` * scale_import, color = \"Import Price Index (TL)\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = \"PPI (%)\",\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / scale_import, name = \"Import Price Index (TL)\")\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"PPI (%)\" = \"blue\", \"Import Price Index (TL)\" = \"orange\")) +\n  labs(title = \"PPI (%) vs Import Price Index (TL) Over Time\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"PPI (%)\",\n       color = \"Variables\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme_economist()\ngraph_import\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ncor_ppi_usd &lt;- dataefe %&gt;%\n  summarize(correlation = cor(`PPI (%)`, USD, use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\"))\ncor_ppi_import &lt;- dataefe %&gt;%\n  summarize(correlation = cor(`PPI (%)`, `Import Unit Value Index (TL)`, use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"pearson\"))\ncor_ppi_usd$correlation\n\n[1] 0.3080418\n\ncor_ppi_import$correlation\n\n[1] 0.4149023\n\n\nThe correlation between PPI and the exchange rate is 0.308, indicating a weak but positive relationship. This suggests that while exchange rate changes affect PPI, the effect may not be very strong or other economic factors play a larger role.\nThe correlation between PPI and Import Price Index is 0.415, indicating a stronger link between the two compared to the¬†exchange¬†rate.\nINDICATORS WHICH HAS MOST STRONG RELATƒ∞ON WITH PPI\nCorrelation Coefficient:\n‚Ä¢ Exchange Rates- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.30804\n‚Ä¢ Energy Price Index- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.25689\n‚Ä¢ Housing Price Index- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.88859\n‚Ä¢ Import Price Index- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.41490\n‚Ä¢ Interest Rates- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.11986\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Confidence Index- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.42212\n‚Ä¢ Consumer Price Index- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.7959363\n‚Ä¢ Credit Card Usage- Producer Price Index (PPI)= 0.60305\nWe can choose the four most important and influential variables from the dataset we are using, then run a regression analysis to see which factors have the biggest effects on the PPI.

Significance of Coefficients\n\nThe p-value for the intercept is 0.00022, and for the PPI coefficient, it is 2.62e-08. Both are much smaller than 0.05, indicating that the coefficients are statistically significant.\nThis means that PPI has a meaningful effect on CCU\n\n\n\n3. Model Fit\n\nMultiple R-squared: 0.3637\n\nThis value suggests that the model explains 36.37% of the variation in usage.\nWhile this indicates a moderate relationship, a significant portion of variation in CCU (%63.63) remains unexplained by PPI alone.\n\nAdjusted R-squared: 0.35440\n\nThis accounts for the number of predictors in the model and indicates a similar level of explanatory power.\n\n\n\n\n4. Overall Model Significance\n\nF-statistic: 39.43 with a p-value of 2.615e-08\n\nThis shows that the model as a whole is statistically significant, meaning that PPI is a significant predictor of CCU.\n\n\n\n\n5. Residual Analysis\n\nThe residuals range from -74.31 to 102.6, with a residual standard error of 42.66.\n\nThis indicates the variability of the predicted values around the observed values.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nThe regression analysis suggests a moderate and statistically significant relationship between PPI and CCU. While the model demonstrates that PPI has a meaningful impact on usage, additional predictors or variables may be needed to better explain the variability in usage.\n\nggplot(table1, aes(x = PPI, y = usage)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = TRUE) + \n  labs(title = \"Regression Analysis: PPI vs CCU\",\n       x = \"Producer Price Index (PPI)\",\n       y = \"Credit Card Usage (CCU)\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression analysis indicates that these two indicators has a relation but we also try polynomial regression analysis.\n\nmodelpoly_ccu &lt;- lm(usage ~ poly(PPI, 2), data = table1)\nsummary(modelpoly_ccu)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = usage ~ poly(PPI, 2), data = table1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-95.850 -26.289  -0.347  26.291  87.385 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

    "text": "R‚ÄôHAPSODY: A Data Analysis Project\nExploring Economic Dynamics Through PPI\nThe R‚ÄôHAPSODY project embarks on a journey to decode one of the Turkish economy‚Äôs pivotal macroeconomic indicators: the Producer Price Index (PPI). Serving as a benchmark for tracking inflation and price shifts in consumer goods, PPI is essential for understanding economic health. However, to gain a more holistic view of economic trends, our project extends its focus to explore how PPI interacts with a range of influential variables.\nData and Sources\nWe have incorporated multiple economic indicators into our analysis, including:\n\nProducer Price Index (PPI)\nExchange Rates\nEnergy Prices\nHousing Prices\nImport Prices\nInterest Rates\nConsumer Confidence\nConsumer Price Index(CPI)\nCredit Card Usage(CCU)\n\nThe dataset, collected from a very trusted source such as the the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB), provides a robust foundation for discovering meaningful patterns and relationships.\nWhy This Data?\nThe Turkish economy is characterized by its complexity, where factors like volatile exchange rates and fluctuating energy prices play outsized roles. By combining PPI with these auxiliary indicators, our project aims to offer fresh perspectives on the intricate web of economic interactions, enhancing our understanding of what drives inflation and consumer behavior in Turkey.\nProject Objectives\n\nUnderstanding Influences: To identify which factors significantly impact PPI.\nMapping Relationships: To examine the interplay between PPI and other economic variables.\nDeriving Insights: To provide a data-backed interpretation of Turkey‚Äôs macroeconomic structure, highlighting critical influences like exchange rates and energy prices.\n\nKey Milestones Achieved\n\nCleaned and integrated diverse datasets to establish a comprehensive analytical framework.\nConducted statistical evaluations to reveal correlations and causal links.\nHighlighted the unique dynamics shaping Turkey‚Äôs inflationary trends, such as the strong ties between PPI and energy price shifts.\n\n\n\nWhich Index Should We Choose as Our Baseline?\nWhen deciding on a baseline index for our analysis, we initially considered both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI). Both indices are critical tools for measuring inflation, but they offer different perspectives on economic dynamics. While CPI focuses on the changes in prices faced by consumers, PPI measures the changes in prices at the production stage, capturing the cost dynamics experienced by producers.\nTo make an informed decision, we conducted a comparative analysis of CPI and PPI as part of the initial phase of our project. This analysis aimed to determine which index would provide deeper insights into the relationships we intended to explore.\nWhy Did We Choose PPI Over CPI?\nOur analysis revealed several key factors that guided our choice:\n\nCloser Link to Input Costs: PPI reflects the prices of goods at earlier stages of production, making it more sensitive to fluctuations in raw material costs, energy prices, and other input factors. This characteristic allows PPI to provide more direct insights into the production side of the economy.\nPredictive Power for Inflation Trends: PPI often serves as a leading indicator for CPI, as changes in producer prices can eventually influence consumer prices. By focusing on PPI, we can capture upstream economic dynamics that may precede broader inflationary trends.\nData Alignment with Objectives: The scope of our project emphasizes the relationships between economic indicators such as energy prices, import prices, and exchange rates‚Äîfactors that strongly impact PPI. This alignment made PPI a more suitable choice for our baseline.\n\nKey Findings from Statistical Tests\nTo reinforce our decision, we conducted correlation, Granger causality, and regression tests:\n\nCorrelation Analysis: We found a strong positive correlation of 0.80 between PPI and CPI, indicating a significant relationship between the two indices.\nGranger Causality Test: The results showed that PPI has a causal influence on CPI, meaning changes in producer prices tend to precede changes in consumer prices.\nRegression Analysis: Regression results further supported that PPI significantly impacts CPI, underlining its predictive power for consumer-level price changes.\n\nThrough this robust comparative and statistical analysis, we determined that PPI offers a more comprehensive foundation for understanding the economic dynamics central to our project. While CPI remains a valuable measure of inflation, PPI‚Äôs closer ties to production-level costs, predictive capabilities, and causal influence on CPI made it the ideal choice for our baseline index.\nThis decision ensures that our analysis is aligned with the project‚Äôs goals and enhances our ability to uncover meaningful relationships in Turkey‚Äôs economic structure.\nHOW DID WE IMPORT OUR DATA?\nWe collect our data from database of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB).\nhttps://evds2.tcmb.gov.tr/\nWe selected the data from last 6 years,starting from 2019.We choose last 6 years and not more than that because we didn‚Äôt want to our data frames be so large and cause long process times.Also we didn‚Äôt want to choose less than 6 year because we want to be sure we have enough data to make our analysis meaningful.\nAs you can understand from above our data frames has a date column.For example:\n\nhead(ppi,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 2\n   Tarih     PPI\n   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 01-2019 32.9 \n 2 02-2019 29.6 \n 3 03-2019 29.6 \n 4 04-2019 30.1 \n 5 05-2019 28.7 \n 6 06-2019 25.0 \n 7 07-2019 21.7 \n 8 08-2019 13.4 \n 9 09-2019  2.45\n10 10-2019  1.7 \n\n\nBut,this format for date is not recognizable for R,therefore we had to transform it to suitable format with this code:\n\nppi$Tarih &lt;- as.Date(paste0(\"01-\", ppi$Tarih), format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\nhead(ppi,10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 √ó 2\n   Tarih        PPI\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 32.9 \n 2 2019-02-01 29.6 \n 3 2019-03-01 29.6 \n 4 2019-04-01 30.1 \n 5 2019-05-01 28.7 \n 6 2019-06-01 25.0 \n 7 2019-07-01 21.7 \n 8 2019-08-01 13.4 \n 9 2019-09-01  2.45\n10 2019-10-01  1.7 \n\n\nWe did this for all data frames to visualize them.This is the only preprocessing we conducted for our data.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nThis study explores the relationship between the Producer Price Index (PPI) and other key economic indicators in Turkey.\nThe data was sourced from TCMB, covering variables like exchange rates, energy prices, and consumer expenditures.\nPPI was selected as the baseline index due to its predictive power and causal relationship with CPI.We treat PPI as inflation rate.\nWe aimed to understand which indicators has a strong relation with inflation rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
