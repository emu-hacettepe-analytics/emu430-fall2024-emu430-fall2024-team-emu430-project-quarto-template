The comparison is conducted on a year-by-year basis, focusing on key demographic indicators such as mortality rates, birth rates, population trends, and other relevant factors.\n\n\nData Set\nWe obtained the data set from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. You can access the relevant data set from the link below:\nhttps://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicator%20(Standard)/EXCEL_FILES/1_General/WPP2024_GEN_F01_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS_COMPACT.xlsx\nThe original data set required a thorough cleaning process to ensure reliability and clarity for analysis.\nCleaning Process and Grouping\n\nCleaning Process:\n\nMissing or incomplete data entries were identified and addressed to maintain the dataset’s integrity.\nDuplicates and irrelevant rows were removed.\nRelevant data for “Turkey,” “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” groups were extracted for focused analysis.\n\nGrouping Process:\nTo simplify and enhance our analysis, the cleaned data set was divided into several key groups based on demographic parameters:\n\nChange in Population: Trends and shifts in population size over the years.\nChild Demographics: Birth rates and child-related population indicators.\nDeath Rate: Annual death rates across groups.\nLife Expectancy: Average life expectancy trends over time.\nMortality: Mortality rates segmented by different age groups and causes.\nPopulation Dynamics: Overall population trends and growth patterns.\nTotal Deaths: Aggregate death counts across years.\nOther Parameters: Additional indicators relevant to the demographic and economic development of regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

By examining critical parameters such as total deaths, crude death rates, and fertility trends, we aim to gain valuable insights into Turkey’s demographic status in relation to other regions with varying levels of development.\nWe will examine these indicators over time to assess whether Turkey’s demographic patterns are more aligned with developed countries, which generally experience better healthcare outcomes, or with less developed countries, where healthcare access may be limited, resulting in different mortality and fertility trends.\n\n\n\nTotal Deaths Comparison: Turkey vs. More Developed vs. Less Developed Countries\nFirst, we generated the “Total Deaths by Year” graphs for Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries. For this, we used specific R codes to filter the data and create the visualizations.\nCode block for the Turkey’s graph:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nInstalling package into 'C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.4'\n(as 'lib' is unspecified)\n\n\npackage 'tidyverse' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpwpU1xT\\downloaded_packages\n\nlibrary(ggplot2) # veya gerekli kütüphaneler\n\n# dplyr paketini yükle (eğer sadece dplyr kullanılacaksa)\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n\nInstalling package into 'C:/Users/HP/AppData/Local/R/win-library/4.4'\n(as 'lib' is unspecified)\n\n\npackage 'dplyr' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\n\nWarning: cannot remove prior installation of package 'dplyr'\n\n\nWarning in file.copy(savedcopy, lib, recursive = TRUE): problem copying\nC:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\R\\win-library\\4.4\\00LOCK\\dplyr\\libs\\x64\\dplyr.dll to\nC:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\R\\win-library\\4.4\\dplyr\\libs\\x64\\dplyr.dll:\nPermission denied\n\n\nWarning: restored 'dplyr'\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\HP\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpwpU1xT\\downloaded_packages\n\n# Yüklenen kütüphaneyi aktif hale getir\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # veya library(dplyr)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(readxl)\ntotal_deaths &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/HP/Desktop/total_deaths.xlsx\")\nView(total_deaths)\ncolnames(total_deaths)\n\n[1] \"Index\"                                         \n[2] \"Country\"                                       \n[3] \"Location code\"                                 \n[4] \"Type\"                                          \n[5] \"Year\"                                          \n[6] \"Total Deaths (thousands)\"                      \n[7] \"Crude Death Rate (deaths per 1,000 population)\"\n\nunique(total_deaths$`Country`)\n\n[1] \"Turkiye\"                   \"More developed regions\"   \n[3] \"Less developed regions\"    \"Least developed countries\"\n\n# Gerekli kütüphaneler\n# Türkiye'ye ait verileri filtreleme\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # veya library(dply\nturkey_data &lt;- total_deaths %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"Turkiye\")\ncolnames(turkey_data)\n\n[1] \"Index\"                                         \n[2] \"Country\"                                       \n[3] \"Location code\"                                 \n[4] \"Type\"                                          \n[5] \"Year\"                                          \n[6] \"Total Deaths (thousands)\"                      \n[7] \"Crude Death Rate (deaths per 1,000 population)\"\n\n# Türkiye verisinin kontrolü\nprint(head(turkey_data))  # İlk birkaç satırı görüntüleyerek kontrol edin\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  Index Country `Location code` Type          Year `Total Deaths (thousands)`\n  &lt;dbl&gt;

By comparing the curves, we can analyze whether Turkey’s death rate aligns more closely with the trend of more developed countries or less developed ones. Factors like healthcare improvements, aging population, and socio-economic conditions may influence these trends.\nDemographic Alignment: From a demographic perspective, we can assess if Turkey’s total deaths trend shows more similarity to that of more developed countries, which generally experience lower death rates due to better healthcare, or if it is closer to less developed countries with potentially higher mortality rates due to limited healthcare access.\nConclusions: Drawing on these trends, Turkey may either resemble developed countries more closely (suggesting improvements in health systems) or share characteristics with less developed regions (highlighting areas that need improvement in public health and healthcare access).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Data source: UN Demographic Indicators Compact (XLSX)\n\nThis dataset provides demographic insights such as population trends, mortality rates, fertility rates, and life expectancy across countries and regions over several decades.\nObjective and Selection Rationale\nThe objective of our analysis is to compare Turkey’s demographic indicators year by year with “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” regions to assess its development status. The dataset was chosen due to its comprehensive nature and reliability as an authoritative source.\nAccomplishments\nBy organizing, cleaning, and processing the data, we aimed to create a streamlined version that enables targeted analysis of specific indicators such as population trends, death rates, life expectancy, and other demographic parameters.\n\nInitial Cleaning Process\n\nWe focused on Turkey, “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” groups by removing data related to other countries and regions.\nColumns that were irrelevant to our objectives were removed, including:\n\nEstimates (Variant)\nNotes\nISO Codes (Alpha-2, Alpha-3, SDmx, Parent)\nPopulation Annual Doubling Time (years)\nCrude Birth Rate (births per 1,000 population)\nAll columns related to migration.\n\n\nSimplifications\n\nRedundant columns for gender-separated data were aggregated into general metrics where possible. For example:\n\nLife Expectancy and Deaths columns for males and females were replaced by general life expectancy and total deaths metrics.\nMetrics such as population density, sex ratios, and mortality rates for specific age groups were excluded to streamline the data set.\n\n\nCustom Metrics\n\nA new Death Rate (%) column was created by calculating the ratio of total deaths to total population. We calculated this ratio on the Excel file.\n\nData Grouping\nThe cleaned data set was organized into the following thematic groups for analysis:\n\nChange in Population:\nIncludes metrics like natural change, population growth rate, and birth counts.\nChild Demographics:\nFocuses on infant and under-five mortality rates, survival rates, and child-specific metrics.\nDeath Rate:\nConsists of total population, total deaths, and the newly calculated death rate.\nLife Expectancy:\nContains life expectancy data directly provided in the original data set.\nMortality:\nIncludes general mortality rates without detailed gender or age group segmentation.\nPopulation Dynamics:\nCovers total population data, broken down by year, as well as male and female distributions.\nOther Parameters:\nIncludes indicators such as fertility rates, mean age at childbearing, and sex ratio at birth.\nTotal Deaths:\nContains data on total deaths and crude death rates.\n\nStoring the Processed Data\nYou can access these modified Excel files by clicking this link.\nTo convert the data into .RData format, we performed the following steps:\n\nFirst, we loaded the original data set into R from an Excel file using the readxl package:\nlibrary(readxl)     file_path &lt;- \"C:/Users/bugra/OneDrive/Belgeler/veri_proje/veri_dataset/total_deaths.xlsx\"     total_deaths &lt;- read_excel(file_path)\nAfter processing and cleaning the data set, the modified data (total_deaths in this case) was saved in the .RData format using the save() function. This format preserves the R objects, making it easier to load and analyze later.\nsave(total_deaths, file = \"C:/Users/bugra/OneDrive/Belgeler/veri_proje/veri_dataset/total_deaths.RData\")\nThe final data set is now available in the .RData format and you can access final cleaned and grouped files that stored in .RData format below:\n.RData Files.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
