    "text": "Analysis Overview:\nThis analysis seeks to explore and compare Turkey’s demographic indicators with those of more developed and less developed regions, based on data provided by the UN Demographic Indicators Dataset. By examining critical parameters such as total deaths, crude death rates, and fertility trends, we aim to gain valuable insights into Turkey’s demographic status in relation to other regions with varying levels of development.\nWe will examine these indicators over time to assess whether Turkey’s demographic patterns are more aligned with developed countries, which generally experience better healthcare outcomes, or with less developed countries, where healthcare access may be limited, resulting in different mortality and fertility trends.\n\n\n\nBirths by Women Aged 15-19: Turkey vs. More Developed vs. Less Developed Countries\nThis graph compares the birth rate among women aged 15-19 in Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries.\nThis code block visualizes the graph:\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(readxl)   # For reading Excel files\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For data manipulation\n\nWarning: package 'tidyverse' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'stringr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'forcats' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\nWarning: package 'lubridate' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)   # For plotting\n\n# Load the data from the Excel file\nother_parameters &lt;- read_excel(\"data/other_parameters.xlsx\")\n\n# Filter the data for Turkey, More Developed, and Less Developed regions\nturkey_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Turkey\")\n\nmore_developed_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"More developed regions\")\n\nless_developed_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Less developed regions\")\n\n# Adding a \"Source\" column to each dataset for identification\nturkey_data_other$Source &lt;- \"Turkey\"\nmore_developed_data_other$Source &lt;- \"More developed\"\nless_developed_data_other$Source &lt;- \"Less developed\"\n\n# Combine the datasets into one\ncombined_data &lt;- rbind(turkey_data_other, more_developed_data_other, less_developed_data_other)\n\n# Plotting the graph for Teenage Birth Percentage\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Teenage Birth Percentage`, color = Source)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Add lines\n  labs(\n    title = \"Teenage Birth Percentage Over Years\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Teenage Birth Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()  # Clean theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeen Birth Rates and Socioeconomic Factors: Teen births are often influenced by socioeconomic, educational, and healthcare factors. Less developed countries typically have higher rates of teen births due to lower access to education and family planning services. By comparing Turkey to both developed and less developed countries, we can analyze where Turkey stands in terms of policies surrounding family planning, education, and access to healthcare.\nUnfortunately, in the 1950s, Turkey was behind even the less developed countries in terms of childbirth. However, since the 1990s, it has first caught up with them and nowadays it has reached the level of more developed countries.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Life Expectancy at Birth Over the Years\nThe following graph illustrates the life expectancy at birth over the years for Turkey, More Developed, and Less Developed countries:\n\nThis code block visualizes the graph:\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(readxl)   # For reading Excel files\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For data manipulation\nlibrary(ggplot2)   # For plotting\n\n# Load the data from the Excel file\nlife_expectancy &lt;- read_excel(\"data/life_expectancy.xlsx\")\n\n# Filter the data for Turkey, More Developed, and Less Developed regions\nturkey_expectancy &lt;- life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Turkey\")\n\nmore_developed_expectancy &lt;- life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"More developed regions\")\n\nless_developed_expectancy &lt;- life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Less developed regions\")\n\n# Adding a \"Source\" column to each dataset for identification\nturkey_expectancy$Source &lt;- \"Turkey\"\nmore_developed_expectancy$Source &lt;- \"More developed regions\"\nless_developed_expectancy$Source &lt;- \"Less developed regions\"\n\n# Combine the datasets into one\ncombined_data &lt;- rbind(turkey_expectancy, more_developed_expectancy, less_developed_expectancy)\n\n# Plotting the graph for Life Expectancy at Birth (both sexes) Over Years\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Life Expectancy at Birth, both sexes (years)`, color = Source)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Add lines for each group\n  labs(\n    title = \"Life Expectancy at Birth, Both Sexes (Years) Over Years\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy at Birth, Both Sexes (Years)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()  # Clean and minimal theme for the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the trends in life expectancy at birth for three distinct groups: Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries.\nThe X-axis represents the years, while the Y-axis shows life expectancy at birth in years.\nEach group (Turkey, More Developed, Less Developed) is represented with different colored lines, allowing for easy comparison.\n\nBy examining the graph:\n\nJust like its geographical location, Turkey serves as a bridge between developed and undeveloped countries in terms of life expectancy as well. However, nowadays, Turkey is extremely close to developed countries. Also, the drops likely caused by COVID-19 in 2020 should not be overlooked.\n\nThis analysis indicates that Turkey is steadily closing the gap with more developed regions, showcasing positive demographic developments in terms of life expectancy.\n\n\nAnalysis of Median Age Over the Years\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(readxl)   # For reading Excel files\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For data manipulation\nlibrary(ggplot2)   # For plotting\n\n# Load the data from the Excel file\nchange_in_population &lt;- read_excel(\"data/change_in_population.xlsx\")\n\n# Filter the data for Turkey, More Developed, and Less Developed regions\nturkey_median_age &lt;- change_in_population %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Turkey\")\n\nmore_developed_median_age &lt;- change_in_population %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"More developed regions\")\n\nless_developed_median_age &lt;- change_in_population %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Less developed regions\")\n\n# Adding a \"Source\" column to each dataset for identification\nturkey_median_age$Source &lt;- \"Turkey\"\nmore_developed_median_age$Source &lt;- \"More developed regions\"\nless_developed_median_age$Source &lt;- \"Less developed regions\"\n\n# Combine the datasets into one\ncombined_data &lt;- rbind(turkey_median_age, more_developed_median_age, less_developed_median_age)\n\n# Plotting the graph for Life Expectancy at Birth (both sexes) Over Years\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Median Age, as of 1 July (years)`, color = Source)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Add lines for each group\n  labs(\n    title = \"Median Age (years)\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Median Age (years)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()  # Clean and minimal theme for the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Turkey had a very young population, even younger than less developed countries. However, even though it later came to have an older population than those countries, it still has a younger population compared to developed countries.\n\n\nAnalysis of Rate Of Natural Change Over the Years\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(readxl)   # For reading Excel files\nlibrary(tidyverse) # For data manipulation\nlibrary(ggplot2)   # For plotting\n\n# Load the data from the Excel file\nchange_in_population &lt;- read_excel(\"data/change_in_population.xlsx\")\n\n# Filter the data for Turkey, More Developed, and Less Developed regions\nturkey_rate_of_natural_change &lt;- change_in_population %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Turkey\")\n\nmore_developed_rate_of_natural_change &lt;- change_in_population %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"More developed regions\")\n\nless_developed_rate_of_natural_change &lt;- change_in_population %&gt;%\n  filter(`Region, subregion, country or area *` == \"Less developed regions\")\n\n# Adding a \"Source\" column to each dataset for identification\nturkey_rate_of_natural_change$Source &lt;- \"Turkey\"\nmore_developed_rate_of_natural_change$Source &lt;- \"More developed regions\"\nless_developed_rate_of_natural_change$Source &lt;- \"Less developed regions\"\n\n# Combine the datasets into one\ncombined_data &lt;- rbind(turkey_rate_of_natural_change, more_developed_rate_of_natural_change, less_developed_rate_of_natural_change)\n\n# Plotting the graph for Life Expectancy at Birth (both sexes) Over Years\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Rate of Natural Change (per 1,000 population)`, color = Source)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Add lines for each group\n  labs(\n    title = \"Rate of Natural Change Over the Years\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Rate of Natural Change (per 1,000 population)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()  # Clean and minimal theme for the plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Turkey had the highest population ratio among the groups we compared, its population growth rate has slowed down since the 2000s to be somewhat lower than less developed countries.

    "text": "Data source: UN Demographic Indicators Compact (XLSX)\n\nThis dataset provides demographic insights such as population trends, mortality rates, fertility rates, and life expectancy across countries and regions over several decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective of Our Analysis\n\nThe objective of our analysis is to conduct a detailed comparison of Turkey’s demographic indicators on a yearly basis, contrasting them with those of regions categorized as “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed.” By examining these indicators over time, we aim to evaluate Turkey’s development status relative to other global regions.\n\n\nReason for Choosing This Dataset\nThe primary reason for selecting this dataset is its reliability and comprehensiveness, provided by the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a globally recognized institution, the United Nations collects and analyzes demographic, economic, and social data that is trusted internationally. Therefore, the data they provide is not only highly reliable but also widely accepted and verified.\nThe United Nations collects demographic data from national statistics offices and reliable sources, such as censuses and surveys. The data is then analyzed using standardized methods to ensure accuracy and comparability across regions and countries. This process allows the UN to create reliable demographic indicators used for global development analysis.\nIn addition to its trustworthiness, this dataset is exceptionally detailed and extensive. The data is presented on an annual basis, which allows us to observe demographic changes over time and provides a sufficient amount of data for conducting comparative analyses. This enables us to assess Turkey’s development status by comparing it with “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” regions, offering a robust foundation for in-depth analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments\nBy organizing, cleaning, and processing the data, we aimed to create a streamlined version that enables targeted analysis of specific indicators such as population trends, death rates, life expectancy, and other demographic parameters.\n\nInitial Cleaning Process\n\nWe focused on Turkey, as well as the “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” groups by removing data related to other countries and regions.\nColumns that were irrelevant to our objectives were removed, including:\n\nEstimates (Variant)\nNotes\nISO Codes (Alpha-2, Alpha-3, SDmx, Parent)\nPopulation Annual Doubling Time (years)\nCrude Birth Rate (births per 1,000 population)\nAll columns related to migration.\n\n\nSimplifications\n\nRedundant columns for gender-separated data were aggregated into general metrics where possible. For example:\n\nLife Expectancy and Deaths columns for males and females were replaced by general life expectancy and total deaths metrics.\nMetrics such as population density, sex ratios, and mortality rates for specific age groups were excluded to streamline the data set.\n\n\nCustom Metrics\n\nA new Death Rate (%) column was created by calculating the ratio of total deaths to the total population. We calculated this ratio using the Excel file.\n\nData Grouping\nThe cleaned data set was organized into the following thematic groups for analysis:\n\nChange in Population:\nMetrics include metrics like natural change, population growth rate, and birth counts.\nChild Demographics:\nThis section focuses on infant and under-five mortality rates, survival rates, and child-specific metrics.\nDeath Rate:\nThis metric consists of the total population, total deaths, and the newly calculated death rate.\nLife Expectancy:\nThe data set contains life expectancy data that was directly provided in the original data set.\nMortality:\nIt includes general mortality rates without detailed gender or age group segmentation.\nPopulation Dynamics:\nThe covers include total population data, which is broken down by year, as well as the distributions ofmale and female populations.\nOther Parameters:\nThe date includes indicators such as fertility rates, mean age at childbearing, and sex ratio at birth.\nTotal Deaths:\nThe section contains data on total deaths and crude death rates.\n\nStoring the Processed Data\nYou can access these modified Excel files by clicking this link.\nTo convert the data into .RData format, we performed the following steps:\n\nFirst, we loaded the original data set into R from an Excel file using the readxl package:\nlibrary(readxl)\nfile_path &lt;- \"data/change_in_population.xlsx\"\nchange_in_population &lt;- read_excel(file_path)\nAfter processing and cleaning the data set, the modified data (total_deaths in this case) was saved in the .RData format using the save() function. This format preserves the R objects, making it easier to load and analyze later.\nsave(change_in_population, file = \"data/change_in_population.RData\")\nThe final data set is now available in the .RData format, and you can access the final cleaned and grouped files stored in .RData format below:\n.RData Files.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
