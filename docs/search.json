By examining critical parameters such as total deaths, crude death rates, and fertility trends, we aim to gain valuable insights into Turkey’s demographic status in relation to other regions with varying levels of development.\nWe will examine these indicators over time to assess whether Turkey’s demographic patterns are more aligned with developed countries, which generally experience better healthcare outcomes, or with less developed countries, where healthcare access may be limited, resulting in different mortality and fertility trends.\n\n\n\nTotal Deaths Comparison: Turkey vs. More Developed vs. Less Developed Countries\nFirst, we generated the “Total Deaths by Year” graphs for Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries. For this, we used specific R codes to filter the data and create the visualizations.\nCode block for the Turkey’s graph:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # Calling the libraries\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(readxl)\ntotal_deaths &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/HP/Desktop/total_deaths.xlsx\")\nView(total_deaths)\ncolnames(total_deaths)\n\n[1] \"Index\"                                         \n[2] \"Country\"                                       \n[3] \"Location code\"                                 \n[4] \"Type\"                                          \n[5] \"Year\"                                          \n[6] \"Total Deaths (thousands)\"                      \n[7] \"Crude Death Rate (deaths per 1,000 population)\"\n\nunique(total_deaths$`Country`)\n\n[1] \"Turkiye\"                   \"More developed regions\"   \n[3] \"Less developed regions\"    \"Least developed countries\"\n\n# filtering the Turkey data\nturkey_data &lt;- total_deaths %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"Turkiye\")\nlibrary(ggplot2) #Drawing the graph\nggplot(turkey_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Total Deaths (thousands)`)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Turkey's Total Deaths by Year\",  \n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Total Deaths (Thousands)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode block for More Developed countries graph:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # Calling the libraries\nlibrary(readxl)\ntotal_deaths &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/HP/Desktop/total_deaths.xlsx\")\nView(total_deaths)\ncolnames(total_deaths)\n\n[1] \"Index\"                                         \n[2] \"Country\"                                       \n[3] \"Location code\"                                 \n[4] \"Type\"                                          \n[5] \"Year\"                                          \n[6] \"Total Deaths (thousands)\"                      \n[7] \"Crude Death Rate (deaths per 1,000 population)\"\n\nunique(total_deaths$`Country`)\n\n[1] \"Turkiye\"                   \"More developed regions\"   \n[3] \"Less developed regions\"    \"Least developed countries\"\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # veya library(dply\nMore_developed &lt;- total_deaths %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"More developed regions\")\n# Drawing the graphs\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(More_developed, aes(x = Year, y = `Total Deaths (thousands)`)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"More_developed country's Total Deaths by Year\",  \n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Total Deaths (Thousands)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode block for More Developed countries graph:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # Calling hte libraries\nlibrary(readxl)\ntotal_deaths &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/HP/Desktop/total_deaths.xlsx\")\nView(total_deaths)\nLess_developed &lt;- total_deaths %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"Less developed regions\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(Less_developed, aes(x = Year, y = `Total Deaths (thousands)`)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Less_developed's Total Deaths by Year\",  \n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Total Deaths (Thousands)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese graphs compares the total deaths over the years for Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries.\n\n\n\nFig.1 shows Turkey’s Total Deaths by Year\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.2 shows More Developed country’s Total Deaths by Year\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.3 shows Less Developed country’s Total Deaths by Year\n\n\n//////bu grafiklerin analizlerini yapmadım.\n\nTrend Analysis: We can observe the trends in total deaths for each group across the years. By comparing the curves, we can analyze whether Turkey’s death rate aligns more closely with the trend of more developed countries or less developed ones. Factors like healthcare improvements, aging population, and socio-economic conditions may influence these trends.\nDemographic Alignment: From a demographic perspective, we can assess if Turkey’s total deaths trend shows more similarity to that of more developed countries, which generally experience lower death rates due to better healthcare, or if it is closer to less developed countries with potentially higher mortality rates due to limited healthcare access.\nConclusions: Drawing on these trends, Turkey may either resemble developed countries more closely (suggesting improvements in health systems) or share characteristics with less developed regions (highlighting areas that need improvement in public health and healthcare access).\n\n\n\n\nBirths by Women Aged 15-19: Turkey vs. More Developed vs. Less Developed Countries\nThis graph compares the birth rate among women aged 15-19 in Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries.\nThis code block visualizes the graph:\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nother_parameters &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/HP/Desktop/other_parameters.xlsx\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # veya library(dplyr)\nldeveloped_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"Less developed regions\")\nturkey_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"Turkiye\")\nldeveloped_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"Less developed regions\")\nmdeveloped_data_other &lt;- other_parameters %&gt;%\n  filter(Country == \"More developed regions\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# Turkey veri setine Source sütunu ekleyin\ndata1 &lt;- turkey_data_other\ndata1$Source &lt;- \"Turkey\"\n\n# More developed veri setine Source sütunu ekleyin\ndata2 &lt;- mdeveloped_data_other\ndata2$Source &lt;- \"More developed\"\n\ndata3 &lt;- ldeveloped_data_other\ndata3$Source &lt;- \"Less developed\"\n\n# İki veri setini birleştirme\ncombined_data &lt;- rbind(data1, data2,data3)\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Births by women aged 15 to 19 (thousands)`, color = Source)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Çizgileri ekleyin\n  labs(\n    title = \"Births by women aged 15 to 19 (thousands) Over Years\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Births by women aged 15 to 19 (thousands)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Interpretation:\n\nTeen Birth Rates and Socioeconomic Factors: Teen births are often influenced by socioeconomic, educational, and healthcare factors. Less developed countries typically have higher rates of teen births due to lower access to education and family planning services. By comparing Turkey to both developed and less developed countries, we can analyze where Turkey stands in terms of policies surrounding family planning, education, and access to healthcare.\nTrends in Turkey: If Turkey’s teen birth rates are closer to those of less developed countries, it might suggest that certain cultural or social factors, or lack of effective health education, contribute to higher teen pregnancies. On the other hand, if Turkey’s rates are closer to those of developed countries, it may reflect effective policy interventions such as better education for young women and improved access to contraception and reproductive health services.\nImplications for Policy: The results could lead to insights on how Turkey can improve its healthcare and education systems to lower teen pregnancies. Comparative analysis with developed countries might reveal strategies and policies that Turkey could adopt to further reduce teen birth rates.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Life Expectancy at Birth Over the Years\nThe following graph illustrates the life expectancy at birth over the years for Turkey, More Developed, and Less Developed countries:\n\nThis code block visualizes the graph:\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlife_expectancy &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/HP/Desktop/life_expectancy.xlsx\")\ncolnames(life_expectancy)\n\n[1] \"Index\"                                        \n[2] \"Region\"                                       \n[3] \"Location code\"                                \n[4] \"Country\"                                      \n[5] \"Year\"                                         \n[6] \"Life Expectancy at Birth\"                     \n[7] \"Life Expectancy at Age 15, both sexes (years)\"\n[8] \"Life Expectancy at Age 65, both sexes (years)\"\n[9] \"Life Expectancy at Age 80, both sexes (years)\"\n\nView(life_expectancy)\nunique(life_expectancy$Country)\n\n[1] \"Country/Area\"      \"Development Group\"\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)  \nturkey_expectancy &lt;- life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  filter(Region == \"Turkiye\")\ncolnames(turkey_expectancy)\n\n[1] \"Index\"                                        \n[2] \"Region\"                                       \n[3] \"Location code\"                                \n[4] \"Country\"                                      \n[5] \"Year\"                                         \n[6] \"Life Expectancy at Birth\"                     \n[7] \"Life Expectancy at Age 15, both sexes (years)\"\n[8] \"Life Expectancy at Age 65, both sexes (years)\"\n[9] \"Life Expectancy at Age 80, both sexes (years)\"\n\nhead(turkey_expectancy)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  Index Region  `Location code` Country       Year `Life Expectancy at Birth`\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 11179 Turkiye             792 Country/Area  1950                       47.3\n2 11180 Turkiye             792 Country/Area  1951                       47.6\n3 11181 Turkiye             792 Country/Area  1952                       48.1\n4 11182 Turkiye             792 Country/Area  1953                       48.2\n5 11183 Turkiye             792 Country/Area  1954                       48.8\n6 11184 Turkiye             792 Country/Area  1955                       49.1\n# ℹ 3 more variables: `Life Expectancy at Age 15, both sexes (years)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Life Expectancy at Age 65, both sexes (years)` &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   `Life Expectancy at Age 80, both sexes (years)` &lt;dbl&gt;\n\nLess_expectancy &lt;- life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  filter(Region == \"Less developed regions\")\nMore_expectancy &lt;- life_expectancy %&gt;%\n  filter(Region == \"More developed regions\")\n# Creating the datasets\ndata1 &lt;- turkey_expectancy\ndata1$Source &lt;- \"Turkey\"\ndata2 &lt;- More_expectancy\ndata2$Source &lt;- \"More developed\"\ndata3 &lt;- Less_expectancy\ndata3$Source &lt;- \"Less developed\"\n# Combining the datasets\ncombined_data &lt;- rbind(data1, data2,data3)\nggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Year, y = `Life Expectancy at Birth`, color = Source)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +  # Çizgileri ekleyin\n  labs(\n    title = \"Life Expectancy at Birth Over Years\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Life Expectancy at Birth\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the trends in life expectancy at birth for three distinct groups: Turkey, More Developed countries, and Less Developed countries.\nThe X-axis represents the years, while the Y-axis shows life expectancy at birth in years.\nEach group (Turkey, More Developed, Less Developed) is represented with different colored lines, allowing for easy comparison.\n\nBy examining the graph:\n\nTurkey’s life expectancy appears to follow a similar upward trajectory as More Developed countries, especially in the recent years. This indicates that Turkey has made substantial progress in terms of healthcare and living conditions, aligning more closely with the developed regions.\nLess Developed countries, on the other hand, generally show a slower increase in life expectancy. This suggests that they still face significant challenges in improving healthcare and living standards.\n\nThis analysis indicates that Turkey is steadily closing the gap with more developed regions, showcasing positive demographic developments in terms of life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Data source: UN Demographic Indicators Compact (XLSX)\n\nThis dataset provides demographic insights such as population trends, mortality rates, fertility rates, and life expectancy across countries and regions over several decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective of Our Analysis\n\nThe objective of our analysis is to conduct a detailed comparison of Turkey’s demographic indicators on a yearly basis, contrasting them with those of regions categorized as “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed.” By examining these indicators over time, we aim to evaluate Turkey’s development status relative to other global regions.\n\n\nReason for Choosing This Dataset\nThe primary reason for selecting this dataset is its reliability and comprehensiveness, provided by the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a globally recognized institution, the United Nations collects and analyzes demographic, economic, and social data that is trusted internationally. Therefore, the data they provide is not only highly reliable but also widely accepted and verified.\nThe United Nations collects demographic data from national statistics offices and reliable sources, such as censuses and surveys. The data is then analyzed using standardized methods to ensure accuracy and comparability across regions and countries. This process allows the UN to create reliable demographic indicators used for global development analysis.\nIn addition to its trustworthiness, this dataset is exceptionally detailed and extensive. The data is presented on an annual basis, which allows us to observe demographic changes over time and provides a sufficient amount of data for conducting comparative analyses. This enables us to assess Turkey’s development status by comparing it with “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” regions, offering a robust foundation for in-depth analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccomplishments\nBy organizing, cleaning, and processing the data, we aimed to create a streamlined version that enables targeted analysis of specific indicators such as population trends, death rates, life expectancy, and other demographic parameters.\n\nInitial Cleaning Process\n\nWe focused on Turkey, as well as the “More Developed,” “Less Developed,” and “Least Developed” groups by removing data related to other countries and regions.\nColumns that were irrelevant to our objectives were removed, including:\n\nEstimates (Variant)\nNotes\nISO Codes (Alpha-2, Alpha-3, SDmx, Parent)\nPopulation Annual Doubling Time (years)\nCrude Birth Rate (births per 1,000 population)\nAll columns related to migration.\n\n\nSimplifications\n\nRedundant columns for gender-separated data were aggregated into general metrics where possible. For example:\n\nLife Expectancy and Deaths columns for males and females were replaced by general life expectancy and total deaths metrics.\nMetrics such as population density, sex ratios, and mortality rates for specific age groups were excluded to streamline the data set.\n\n\nCustom Metrics\n\nA new Death Rate (%) column was created by calculating the ratio of total deaths to the total population. We calculated this ratio using the Excel file.\n\nData Grouping\nThe cleaned data set was organized into the following thematic groups for analysis:\n\nChange in Population:\nMetrics include metrics like natural change, population growth rate, and birth counts.\nChild Demographics:\nThis section focuses on infant and under-five mortality rates, survival rates, and child-specific metrics.\nDeath Rate:\nThis metric consists of the total population, total deaths, and the newly calculated death rate.\nLife Expectancy:\nThe data set contains life expectancy data that was directly provided in the original data set.\nMortality:\nIt includes general mortality rates without detailed gender or age group segmentation.\nPopulation Dynamics:\nThe covers include total population data, which is broken down by year, as well as the distributions ofmale and female populations.\nOther Parameters:\nThe date includes indicators such as fertility rates, mean age at childbearing, and sex ratio at birth.\nTotal Deaths:\nThe section contains data on total deaths and crude death rates.\n\nStoring the Processed Data\nYou can access these modified Excel files by clicking this link.\nTo convert the data into .RData format, we performed the following steps:\n\nFirst, we loaded the original data set into R from an Excel file using the readxl package:\nlibrary(readxl)     file_path &lt;- \"C:/Users/bugra/OneDrive/Belgeler/veri_proje/veri_dataset/total_deaths.xlsx\"     total_deaths &lt;- read_excel(file_path)\nAfter processing and cleaning the data set, the modified data (total_deaths in this case) was saved in the .RData format using the save() function. This format preserves the R objects, making it easier to load and analyze later.\nsave(total_deaths, file = \"C:/Users/bugra/OneDrive/Belgeler/veri_proje/veri_dataset/total_deaths.RData\")\nThe final data set is now available in the .RData format, and you can access the final cleaned and grouped files stored in .RData format below:\n.RData Files.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
